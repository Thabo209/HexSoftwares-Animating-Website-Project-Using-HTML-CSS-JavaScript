   - The logo and hero text fade in with a slight delay between elements

2. **Interactive Animations**
   - When clicking between categories, the gallery items fade out smoothly before the new items appear
   - Gallery cards have enhanced hover effects with a more pronounced lift and shadow
   - The lightbox now has a smooth scale animation when opening and closing

3. **Technical Enhancements**
   - Added CSS keyframe animations for consistent motion effects
